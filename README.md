## Project Overview

This web application is built using the Django framework and leverages TensorFlow and Keras for the backend deep learning tasks. Users can upload images, and the trained model will identify the objects present in the images with accuracy.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Run the Django development server:
python manage.py runserver
4. Access the web application by opening your web browser and navigating to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## Usage

1. Open the web application in your browser.
2. Upload an image using the provided form.
3. Submit the form to get object identification results.
4. The web page will display the identified objects along with their confidence scores.
